## Summary of Progress

1. **Project Kickoff**  
   - Officially kicked off the BuddyPlan development project.

2. **Requirement Definition Document Finalized**  
   - Clarified functional and non-functional requirements for BuddyPlan  
   - Included features like SNS functionality, scheduling, security, and AWS deployment considerations  

3. **Project Directory Structure Established**  
   - Defined clean folder layout for backend (FastAPI), frontend (React), infrastructure (AWS/Docker), and documentation  
   - Discussed role of nginx and confirmed ELB usage without nginx unless future need arises  

4. **User Stories Created and Placed into Basic Design**  
   - Broke down requirements into epics and detailed user stories  
   - Confirmed user stories belong in `/docs/BasicDesign/UserStories.md`  
   - Prepared markdown user stories file template  

5. **Next Steps Defined**  
   - Recommended next deliverables: Screen Transition Diagram, Database Schema, API Endpoint Spec, Component List  
   - Decided to focus on clear functional outlines rather than detailed UI design for screen flow at this stage  

6. **Documentation Format Discussion**  
   - Confirmed `.md` files are preferred for all documentation due to simplicity and integration with Git  
   - For screen transition diagrams, plan to embed external images or use simple ASCII diagrams in markdown  

7. **Tool Recommendations for Tomorrow’s Work**  
   - Suggested Draw.io (diagrams.net) for screen transition diagrams due to ease and flexibility  
   - Figma recommended for future UI wireframes and detailed designs  

## Action Items for Next Meeting

- Create Screen Transition Diagram using Draw.io  
- Draft Database Schema and API Endpoint Specification  
- Set up project repositories and initial boilerplate code
